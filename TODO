TODOs

- rss feed
- make jinja template for long-form blogposts that looks consistent with the homepage
- html ids for all albums/compos/commissions/songs so that the announcement feed can link directly to them
    - automatically make appropriate table visible when user clicks on an anchor link to an album/song

- simple genre tag/search/sort system for misc tracks
    - a way for listeners to know what genre the song is before they play it

DONE


- hide posts in the news feed beyond the Xth entry
    - show archive of all posts if the user clicks an "older posts" button or on a separate page
